; Collect action. The robot collects a sample at a location.
; Both the robot and the sample must be in that location.
; The robot's gripper must be free (the robot can only hold 1 sample).
; Consequences:
;   - The sample is no longer at the given location.
;   - The robot is now carrying the sampple and its gripper is not free.
